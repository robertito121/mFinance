Roberto -> Singleton: implemented using the ObjectListSingleTon which will read objects from the file into its respective data structures as soon as the application starts;


Interface Design Patterns:
Roberto -> Walkthrough: this has been implemented using tooltips for some of the implemented menu and Menu Items, in order to increase awareness of the various
                        functions the application has to offer. There will be more implemented tooltips as we code the rest of the use cases.
